[1m[97mJEST OPTIONS[39m[22m

  [94m--platform <p>[39m
  [97mTarget react-native platform. This must refer to a platform which has a
  react-native implementation, such as ios, android, windows or macos. When
  given, react-native module resolution is used. Otherwise, modules are
  resolved using the configured TypeScript strategy.[39m

  [94m--platformExtensions <ext-1>[,<ext-2>[...<ext-N>]][39m
  [97mList of platform file extensions to use when resolving react-native
  modules. Resolution always starts with the --platform name, followed by these
  extensions, ordered from highest precedence (ext-1) to lowest (ext-N).[39m

    [97mExample:[39m
      [94mjest.js --platform ios --platformExtensions mobile,native[39m
      [97mResolution of module 'm' searchs for m.ios.* first, then m.mobile.*,
      m.native.*, and finally m.* (no extension).[39m

  [94m--disableReactNativePackageSubstitution[39m
  [97mThe react-native resolver maps module references from 'react-native' to
  the target platform's implementation, such as 'react-native-windows' for
  Windows, and 'react-native-macos' MacOS. This option disables that
  behavior.[39m

  [94m--traceReactNativeModuleResolutionErrors[39m
  [97mWhen the react-native resolver is active, display a detailed report
  whenever it fails to map a module to a file name.[39m

  [94m--traceResolutionLog <logFile>[39m
  [97mWrite all resolution trace messages to a log file, instead of to the
  console. Trace messages are appended to the end of the file, and it is
  created if it doesn't exist.[39m
